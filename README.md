DO is an opinionated framework for .NET.

It proposes well designed conventions to help you express your application
logic with ease. It doesn't reinvent libraries that already exists, but brings
them together with built-in configurations.

We've just started this project, and hopefully will have the first full release
within 2-3 months. Check out our documentation site for more information
