# Unreleased

## Features

- Beta features are available in `Baked.Recipe.Service.Application`;
  - Introducing UI Conventions: `UiLayer` and `ThemeFeature` now provides
    several convention and extension classes to allow you to build your page
    descriptors via conventions instead of configuring them one by one
