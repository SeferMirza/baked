## v0.19.0

### Packages

This release introduces a package renaming and rebundling prior to v1.0;

- `Baked`: The implementation package (previously `Baked.Architecture` and
  `Baked.Recipe.Service`)
- `Baked.Abstractions`: The abstraction package (previously `Baked.Service`)
- `@mouseless/baked`: The UI package (previously `baked-recipe-admin`)

### Improvements

- Renamed `Service` recipe as `Monolith`
- `ServiceNfr` and `ServiceSpec` renamed as `MonolithNfr` and `MonolithSpec`
  respectively
- UI components are moved from `Baked.Theme.Default` to `Baked.Ui` namespace
- Convention extensions are standardized
  - `whenType:`, `whenProperty:`, `whenMethod:`, `whenParameter:` are all
    renamed as `when:` to match other convention extensions
  - `apply:` parameter in metadata configuration extensions are renamed as
    `attribute:` to match `Set/Add`
  - First parameter of `when:` in metadata configuration extensions is changed
    to context instead of attribute for consistency with other extensions
  - All metadata convention and configurations are renamed as attribute, e.g.,
    `SetTypeMetadata` -> `SetTypeAttribute`
  - `whenComponent:` is renamed as `where:` for better readability
- `String` UI component is renamed as `Text`
- The `add` and `set` methods in `Caster` are made `internal`
- `RequestResponseExamples` and `RequestResponseExamplesData` moved from
  `Baked.Abstractions` to `Baked`
- `primevue`, `primeicons` and `@primeuix/themes` where bundled dependencies
  which was increasing the package size, fixed
- Some `primevue` styles were not loading due to duplication caused by bundling,
  fixed
- `Lazy` prefix in generated `.baked/components.js` are removed for simplicity
  - This is experimental and any issues will be fixed prior to v1.0
