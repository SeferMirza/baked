### .NET Upgrade

DO now supports .NET 8! Below you can find a task list to upgrade your projects.

```markdown
- [ ] Upgrade .NET and C# versions
  - [ ] in projects
  - [ ] in docker files
  - [ ] in GitHub workflows
- [ ] Upgrade DO version
- [ ] Syntax improvements
  - [ ] Use primary constructors
  - [ ] Use collection expressions
- [ ] Use `[FromKeyedServices]` and `[FromServices]` in controllers
```

#### Upgrade .NET and C# versions

- Upgrade the project's `C#` language to `12`.
- Framework version upgrade to `net8.0` in the projects.
- Framework and sdk version upgrade to `8` in `Dockerfile`.
- Upgrade dotnet version `8` in Github actions.

#### Syntax improvements

##### Primary constructors

Use primary constructor, when there is a dependency that needs to be injected at
the constructor without any logic or when the base class constructor is called.
Parameter names start with underscore.

```csharp
public class Entity(IEntityContext<Entity> _context)
{
  ...
}
```

##### Collection expressions

Use new and simplified collection expressions, where possible.

Visit [Collection expression][] for more details.

#### `[FromServices]` in controllers

Instead of using constructor injection, use `[FromServices]` attribute to inject
dependencies in controllers.

```csharp
public Entity Get([FromServices] IQueryContext<Entity> entityQuery) { }
```

### Improvements

- `ExceptionHandling` now uses
  `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.IExceptionHandling`
  - `ExceptionHandling` feature now adds `StatusCodePages` middleware.
- Exceptions now return `ProblemDetails` as response
- `ISystem` is replaced with `TimeProvider.System`
  - `Mocker`, `TheSystem` extension is renamed to `TheTime`
  - Use `FakeTimeProvider` for tests by mocking `TheTime`
- Internal Server Error response included extra details in message, removed
  - Extra details can be reached from the logs
- `HandledException` is now abstract
  - Added optional `ExtraDetails` collection property to `HandledException`
