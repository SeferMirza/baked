# UX

Add this feature using `AddUx()` extension;

```csharp
app.Features.AddUx([...]);
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> Notice this is a multiple feature, meaning you may add more than one UX
> features. Since `AddUxes()` doesn't read well, while being still available, we
> kept the singular `AddUx` naming as the default.
